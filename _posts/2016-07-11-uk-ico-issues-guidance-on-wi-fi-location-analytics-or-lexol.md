  United Kingdom March 1 2016 Earlier this month, the UK data protection
  authority, the Information Commissioner's Officer ("ICO"), published guidance
  on safely processing personal data derived from Wi-Fi location analytics. This
  guidance is important not only to retail businesses who provide Wi-Fi networks
  to their customers, but also to companies who just provide Wi-Fi access solely
